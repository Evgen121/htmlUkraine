                    </h1>
                    <div class="content__body">
                        <p>Like a butterfly emerging from a long, cocooned dormancy and against all odds, since gaining
                            independence in 1991, Ukraine had been breaking through in its development and spreading its
                            wings – a metamorphosis decades in the making. Progress was hampered by an ongoing conflict
                            so protracted that it was rarely making international headlines despite the persisting
                            shelling and mines in the eastern part of the country.</p>

                        <p>Now, the Ukrainian war dominates headlines across the globe. In addition to taking thousands
                            of lives, the conflict has forced some 12 million people to flee their homes. More than five
                            million have left the country, 90% of whom are women and children. </p>
                        <p>The Ukraine war, which risks pushing more than 90% of the population below the poverty line,
                            is already having a detrimental effect on food security, energy and finance for most
                            vulnerable people and countries around the world.</p>
                        <p>Ukraine: a country built on hope
                            Between 2014 and 2022, Ukraine has changed a lot, people are striving to build their country
                            in a legal and democratic direction, this path has been very difficult and many mistakes
                            have been made, but Ukraine is moving forward in key areas of reform; resilience triumphed
                            over despair, and the country overcame the economic and human consequences of the ongoing
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>It was deep in society, especially the youth and local communities, that I found change most
                            dynamic. Everyone I met in the country told me their desire was for Ukraine to progress, to
                            move closer to Europe. Many young people wanted to be educated abroad so they could come
                            back to rebuild their country, to make it even more modern and greener. Many companies
                            produce
                            digital innovations are proving essential
                            now, providing life-saving information, services and humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians
                            across the country.</p>
                        <p>
                            How Ukraine is set to recover
                            As part of its reform agenda and EU integration processes, Ukraine was breaking ground in
                            the fight against corruption by establishing new anti-corruption laws, institutions and
                            tools even more modern than many of those on offer in Europe. Our teams across the country
                            were working with the government, civil society and many other partners to achieve this.
                            Ukraine’s progress in many areas of reform, whether health, economic development or
                            anti-corruption, has provided a strong foundation to help the country recover when the war
                            ends. </p>
                        <p>The same is true for all the Ukrainians I met. “We can be bombed, destroyed or killed, but
                            the war can never take our soul, our identity,” said my former colleague Yana, who fled to
                            Romania with her mother and her two-year-old daughter, leaving her husband and father as
                            dictated by martial law in Ukraine. “I hope the war will end soon so that we can rebuild our
                            land even more beautiful and greener than ever before,” she smiles, her warm eyes sparkling
                            with optimism.</p>
